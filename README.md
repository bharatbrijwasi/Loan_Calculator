# Loan Calculator
A loan calculator program that computes both monthly and total
payments for a given loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan period.
 
### Overall Plan
--for developing the solution we used Incermental development approch--

Let's put down the outline of program flow explicity. we can express the program flow as having three tasks:
1. Get three input values: LoanAmount, interestRate, and loanPeriod.
2. Compute the monthly and total payments.
3. Output the resulte

## The Formula for computing the monthly payment can be found in any mathematics book that covers geometric sequences.It is

Monthly payment = L * R/(1 - [1/(1 + R)]n-times
